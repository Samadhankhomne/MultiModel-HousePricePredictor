 MultiModel-HousePricePredictor is a comprehensive Flask application that allows usersto experiment with various machine learning models to predict housing prices based on key features like average area income, house age, number of rooms, bedrooms, and area population. This project includes pre-trained models—such as Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, XGBoost, and LightGBM—all saved as pickle files for easy loading. The repository also includes a detailed evaluation of each model with metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² scores saved in a CSV file. The app’s web interface provides an intuitive experience where users can select models, enter data, and instantly view predictions along with model performance summaries, making it a useful tool for real estate analytics and machine learning exploration.
